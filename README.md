### A robot which locates an electric vehicle's charging port and plugs it in autonomously.

 - '1.1_Spencer Ball_Assembly Drawing.pdf' contains complete engineering drawings of multiple components I designed for this robot.
 - 'FullAssembly_Render8.png' is a good quality rendering of the full assembly.
 - 'Circuitry_Simple_V2.png' is a simplified circuitry diagram which helped guide our construction of the robot.

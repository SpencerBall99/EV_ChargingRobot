## What is it?
An autonomous robot which locates an electric vehicle's charging port and plugs it in.

## Video
Watch our robot move under manual control here:  https://youtu.be/Z2Zl5m5ZBxk   
This was filmed at the second-to-last milestone in the project, directly before we calibrated it for autonomous operation. 

## What files are in this repository?

 - '1.1_Spencer Ball_Assembly Drawing.pdf' contains complete engineering drawings of multiple components I designed for this robot.
 - 'FullAssembly.dwg' is the CAD file containing the drawing of the fully assembled robot.
 - 'FullAssembly_Render8.png' is a good quality rendering of the full assembly.
 - 'Circuitry_Simple_V2.png' is a simplified circuitry diagram which helped guide our construction of the robot.

# EV_ChargingRobot

## What is it?

## Results
Due to COVID-19, this project was never fully completed. That being said, we did make significant progress towards a final product before all students were sent home for the year. The video linked above shows the robot functioning with us controlling it manually. This was filmed at the second-to-last milestone in the project, directly before we were planning on calibrating it for autonomous operation. 

## What files are in this repository?

 - 'EVChargeBot.avi' is the video of our robot being controlled manually.
 - '1.1_Spencer Ball_Assembly Drawing.pdf' contains complete engineering drawings of multiple components I designed for this robot.
 - 'FullAssembly.dwg' is the CAD file containing the drawing of the fully assembled robot.
 - 'FullAssembly_Render8.png' is a good quality rendering of the full assembly.
 - 'Circuitry_Simple_V2.png' is a simplified circuitry diagram which helped guide our construction of the robot.
